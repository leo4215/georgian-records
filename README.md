# Georgian Records

Authors: Leonardo, Renata, Marcos, Lucas and Megumi

This project represents a responsive website for a fictitious company we created for the final project of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript course I took during the first term of Computer Programming at Georgian College.

The purpose of this project was to create a website for a fictitious company in order to sell a real or imaginary product. The product chosen was a record player. The responsive website has a navigation bar in the header, useful links in the footer, and pages regarding the company, details about the product itself, fictitious customers reviews, a support form and a "about us" page.
